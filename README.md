# 🎯 Credit Card Targeting Optimization Using Customer Segmentation

## 🧠 Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior data to improve the targeting strategy for a fictional credit card product. The goal was to use clustering to identify high-value segments, simulate performance of a new campaign, and deliver data-driven recommendations.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement
- Increase conversion rates of credit card offers by targeting the right customer segments.
- Reduce marketing spend on low-yield groups.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** for data extraction and filtering
- **PowerPoint** for stakeholder presentation

---

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Used SQL and Pandas to preprocess 100K+ rows of customer data (demographics, credit scores, transaction behavior).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Identified patterns in income, credit utilization, and product usage.

3. **Customer Segmentation**  
   Applied k-means clustering to find high-conversion potential groups based on:
   - Credit score
   - Annual income
   - Avg. monthly transaction volume
   - Number of products used

4. **Campaign Simulation**  
   Built A/B test scenario to estimate performance improvements. Found:
   - 18% projected increase in conversion
   - ~$150K potential annual revenue lift

5. **Presentation to Stakeholders**  
   Created a deck summarizing findings and recommended targeting strategy changes.

## 📈 Results
- Identified 3 high-potential customer segments.
- Proposed strategy with higher predicted ROI for direct marketing.
- Built reproducible pipeline for re-segmentation as new data arrives.
